                 &copy;Oven Studios  Is a movie, Animation (2D and 3D) creative Design (graphics etc…), music and general audio recording studio that started as a music instrumentals production firm. It was started in 2009 by four music enthusiasts from Ghana, A country in West Africa.<br/>
                It evolved into a general media studio over time due to the saturation of the music industry with mediocre material.
                The aim of the studio is to “save” the Ghanaian media production from crumbling under mediocrity.<br/>
                Not to say that the studio itself is perfect in anyway. We’ve made some pretty sick songs and some not so appealing once.
                The trick is to recognize your flaws and fix them.
